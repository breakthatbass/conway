# Conway's Game of Life
This is a visualization program of John Conway's [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) algorithm. It's one of my favorite algorthms and it's super cool to watch it in action. I chose to do do mine recursively.

## Usage
```
conway
```
or to specify a grid size
```
conway <size>
```
The default grid size is 20x20 since that will fit in the default terminal size. I think it looks best if you resize the terminal to fit a 50x50 grid. That would be a resizing of 100x50 of the terminal.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/breakthatbass/conway.git
cd conway
make install
```

## uninstall
```
cd conway
make uninstall
```

## TODO
1. add more starting patterns
